# TIC TAC TOE

**Title**: Tic Tac Toe <br>
**Date**: 12 September 2022 <br>
**Deliverable**: CSS/HTML/JS Webpage <br>


For week 2, the assignment was to make a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have made a Tic Tac Toe Game using javascript. There's only one mode in the game i.e. Player vs Computer.

### WireFrame 

For the project I created one wireframe.

### Process & Insights

After preparing the wireframe, it seemed really simple to recreate.  <br>

I translated the wireframe using the table tags of html. With the help of CSS, have custom styled every component of the webpage. <br>

The real problem for this game was to develop the javascript codes. Using the buttons I have taken user inputs at the start of the game, if O is chosen the computer moves first. After chosing the X or O, the other button despairs. I have disabled the X and O buttons after they are clicked to start the game. I have generated a random computer move in an empty square and disables that square. After every turn I have checked if the combination matches or not to win the game. If combination matches, the board automatically resets. <br>

To understand the logic of the game I have used Geeks4Geeks website. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-tic-tac-toe-game-using-javascript/
